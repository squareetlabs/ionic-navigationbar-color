# public support
#--------------------
Since this plugin project is open source, I give you free public support.
I almost all cases ask you to share your project files on Github or other git repository services.
I don't matter if it is public or private repo.
However screen captures or screen records are posted in public issue thread.
(Code are not discovered as much as possible)

The person who share your project files on Github (or other git repository) is in faster lane than other people.
